phrase this narratively start with kneel 1984

It’s that time of the year again. National build-a-scarecrow day. No, hold on. It’s the other thing happening this Sunday…
<br /> <br />
July 4th -- right. Tensions this year are (seemingly) higher then ever before as debates over whether to celebrate are higher then ever before. Some people will tell you that celebrating makes you an automatic racist as you’re disrespecting millions of people who’ve been persecuted under the flag of the United States of America and celebrating mass genocide and imperialism. Others will tell you that not celebrating makes you unpatriotic and apathetic to war heroes who lived, served, and died for the flag.
<br /> <br />
So -- who’s right?
<br /> <br />
<a className="subtitle undl"> Neither. </a>
<br /> <br />
The problem here lies within the framing of the question. The assumption of a binary. It either is or it isn’t true. Many problems nowadays are posed in this sense when, as usual, the actual answer is both multifaceted and much more complex them people online and on the news will want you to beleive. The underlying assumption to every yes-or-no question is that both options are mutually exclusive. That is, both cannot be true at the same time. 
<br /> <br />
Yes, the United States has meant freedom and a better life for a lot of people, and, yes, it has also been a symbol of persecution and suffering for a lot of people. Yes, celebrating independence day is masively disrespectful to those that have been killed in the name of the flag, and, yes, the vice versa is disrespectful to those that served for the flag. Anyone who pretends otherwise (looking at you, PragerU) and tells you that it is completely one way or another is ignorant and discrediting/minimizing life experiences of millions of people.
<br /> <br />
This is the same situation as kneeling for the national anthem. Here the question of whether it is “justified” comes to the forefront. Again, people will completely generalize their own life experiences to those of everyone and pretend like kneeling is some kind of targeted anti-american move that is completely offensive when, in reality, it’s a clear message about one’s own life experiences that seems to have gone right over the heads of those who would rather bury their head in the sand and make (often racist) generalizations about people that kneel for the anthem.
<br /> <br />
Another topic that often comes up is the issue of patriotism. Patriotism is defined as “vigourous support of one’s country”. Many people take this literally and categorize themselves as patriots when I don’t think they should be. The foundation of America is democracy, and, as such, using your voice against the status quo of America and not celebrating independence day and instead using the day to reflect on the violations of freeedom that have occurred can be seen as, well, the most american/patriotic thing one can do.

PATRIOTISM QUOTE
<br /> <br />
Another thing that’s often lost in discussions like these is the importance of motive. Not everyone celebrating independence day is a racist who’s trying to celebrate genocide and persecution. 
<br /> <br />
<a className="subtitle bold"> A new view </a>
<br /> <br />
How do we approach the problem without minimizing the experiences and perspective of millions of people? Well, there’s no perfect solution, but here’s what I think.
<br /> <br />
We cannot ignore the millions, from Native Americans to women to other minority groups (such as Japanese citizens during WW2) who have been violently and abhorrently wronged by the United States of America. We must use July 4th as a day to reflect on the past to focus on the future while staying grounded in the present. Absolutely nothing can make up for the history of this country. 
<br /> <br />
Meeting with family and watching fireworks to have a good time doesn’t make anybody a racist, but it does make them ignorant to the experiences of their metaphorical neighbor. Their neighbor who cannot truly celebrate July 4th as the flag has not and does not stand for their freedom. Their neighbor, on who’s historical and continued suffering the society they live in has been constructed. Just because America has treated you well does not mean that it has treated everyone well. If you do celebrate, be thoughtful.
<br /> <br />
The only thing we can do is make strides towards a day when the country can truly symbolize the tenets that it has been built on. We cannot ignore the past, and we must make progress everyday to a more inclusive society that we can all be proud to live in. One that we can all celebrate.
<br /> <br />
